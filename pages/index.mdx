# Rymon Yu

I'm building [**Versa**](https://versawallet.io) to discover a new way to interact with blockchain. I am extremely excited about the world of Software 3.0, and powerful tools to transform industries.

Previously:

- Studied electrical engineering and computer science at [**Imperial**](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/).
- Spent some time in the venture capital world, and a Fellow at [**GGV**](https://ggvc.com).
- Worked on vSLAM algorithms and research at DJI and SenseTime.
- Was a competitive swimmer in New Zealand.
